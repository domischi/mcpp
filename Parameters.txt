|INTRODUCTION|
--------------
    This file explains you what the parameters are, the default values and sometimes what is useful. I however do not guarantee that this list is complete and/or correct. Where no default value is given, the parameter needs to be given explicitly or the code just doesn't start.

    All parameters are given in the format
    (Parameter Name): short description
    Default: (Default value / none if needed)
    (possible longer description to clarify things)

--------------
|INTERACTIONS|
--------------
    D: Dipolar Interaction Strength
    Default: 0.

    cutoff_distance: Distance at where the dipolar interaction shall be truncated
    Default: 3.
    This is measured in units of a, therefore just changing a doesn't change anything about the truncation 

    Dilution Rate: Vacancy concentration for dipolar interaction
    Default: 0.

    Positional Disorder: Describes the position disorder of sites
    Default: 0.
    The positional disorder is given as a 2D Gaussian with standart deviation equal to this parameter centered around 0

    debug dipolar: print information about the coordinates in the dipolar case
    Default: false
    Mainly useful if positional disorder is introduced, otherwise please use "print debug information"

    J: Exchange Strength
    Default: 0.
    Describes NN Interactions

    A: Shape Anisotropy strength
    Default: 0.

    p_max: Number of Minima for the Shape Anisotropy
    Default: 0.

    Remarks:
        - In the program is distinguished by a disordered and a non disordered dipolar class via a template
        - Shape Anisotropy class gets only loaded if both, A and p_max are defined
        - If no Hamiltonian is loaded an error message should appear and the program terminate

|GEOMETRY DETAILS|
------------------
    LATTICE: Name of the Lattice to use
    Default: (none)
    This is determined by the ALPS library, refere to their list of appplicable lattices

    L: Linear length of lattice
    Default: (none)
    This is the linear length, not total number of sites (e.g. square lattice has L^2 sites)

    a: length of 1st basis vector
    Default: 1.

---------------------------
|OTHER PHYSICAL QUANTITIES|
---------------------------
    beta: inverse Temperature in natural units
    T: Temperature in natural units
    Default: (none)
    Define only one of them, otherwise undefined behaviour

----------------------
|SIMULATIONAL DETAILS|
----------------------
    THERMALIZATION: Number of Lattice Sweeps for thermalization
    Default: 100
    
    SWEEPS: Number of Measurements
    Default: 5000
    This is not the number of lattice sweeps but measurements (there is a factor inbetween determining the frequency of measurements)

    EACH_MEASUREMENT: Describes the Time between successive measurements
    Default: 15

    UPDATE: Type of Update Procedure to use
    Default: (none)
    at the moment only one update type is allowed, namely 'ssf', which stands for single spin flip. 

    Targeted Acceptance Ratio: Fraction of accepted steps to aim for
    Default: 0.5

    Angle Deviation Start: Which angle deviation to start with
    Default: PI/10.
    
    Angle Deviation Factor: Update factor for angle deviation
    Default: 1.2
    Determines the update factor such that the acceptance ratio will be achieved

    Angle Deviation Min: Lowest acceptable angle deviation
    Default: PI/1000.

    Angle Deviation Max: Maximal acceptable angle deviation
    Default: 2*PI

    Initialization: Initialize as...
    Default: "GS"
    Possible choices are:
        "GS":       Ground state
        "Random":   Randomized inital setup

    NUM_CLONES: Number of copies of simulation
    Default: 1
    This allows to use more compuation power for the same task, gather faster statistics, however the thermalization is not able to speed up with this

    SEED: Number seeding the RNG responsible for standart actions
    Default: (given by ALPS)
    This allows to seed your own RNG, however ALPS provides one if not given
    
    DISORDER_SEED: Number seeding the disorder RNG
    Default: (given by ALPS)
    This allows to seed your own RNG, however ALPS provides one if not given

    print debug information:
    Default: False
    Prints the periodic translations as well as the coordinates of each site, only use this for short tests, as otherwise the ouput files explode in length

|OBSERVABLES|
-------------
    MCRG
    ----
    mcrg_iteration_depth: Number of iterations done with MCRG
    Default: -1 (no MCRG measurement is done)

    MCRG Interactions: which correlations to actually measure
    Default: (none)
    Implemented in the interactions.h file, possible choices at the moment are:
        "small":                standart set, probably enough
        "medium interactions":  introduces a few more exotic interactions
        "medium range":         stays with rather conservative interactions, however increases the range compared to small
        "massive":              is broken and anyway too big for any use, at the moment DO NOT USE

    MCRG Reduction Technique:
    Default: (none)
    Implemented in the reductions.h file, possible choices at the moment are:
        "Decimation":           Uses only a 4th of the spins, ignoring the others
        "Blockspin":            Compute the average over 4 spins in a Block and use these as new ones
        "FerroBlockspin":       Same as Blockspin but first rotating the spins, such that the GS is transformed the ferromagnetic
        "Blockspin4x4":         Use the same as Blockspin but with 16(=4*4) spins
        "FerroBlockspin4x4":    Same as Blockspin4x4/FerroBlockspin, transform then average over 4*4 spins
    These are randomized in successive measurements over the starting points of the blocks

    Structure Factor
    ----------------
    structure_factor: Boolean if structure factor shall be measured
    Default: False

    Spin Autocorrelation Time
    -------------------------
    Spin Autocorrelation analysis length: In which depth to analyse the spin autocorrelation
    Default: -1
    As the full configuration get saved, this can be a time and mostly time consuming task, consider that the class contains (this parameter) * N doubles and in every measurement compare a configuration to all the old ones. Use smaller lattices to still have a fast access to the data
    
    Last Configuration
    -------------------------
    measure last configuration: boolean to determine if it should measure the last configuration or not
    Default: False
