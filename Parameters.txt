|INTRODUCTION|
--------------
    This file explains you what the parameters are, the default values and sometimes what is useful. I however do not guarantee that this list is complete and/or correct. Where no default value is given, the parameter needs to be given explicitly or the code just doesn't start.

    All parameters are given in the format
    (Parameter Name): short description
    Default: (Default value / none if needed)
    (possible longer description to clarify things)

--------------
|INTERACTIONS|
--------------
    D: Dipolar Interaction Strength
    Default: 0.

    cutoff_distance: Distance at where the dipolar interaction shall be truncated
    Default: 3.
    This is measured in units of a, therefore just changing a doesn't change anything about the truncation 

    Dilution Rate: Vacancy concentration for dipolar interaction
    Default: 0.

    Positional Disorder: Describes the position disorder of sites
    Default: 0.
    The positional disorder is given as a 2D Gaussian with standart deviation equal to this parameter centered around 0

    debug dipolar: print information about the coordinates in the dipolar case
    Default: false
    Mainly useful if positional disorder is introduced, otherwise please use "print debug information"

    J: Exchange Strength
    Default: 0.
    Describes NN Interactions

    Shape Anisotropy Strength:
    Default: 0.
    Hamiltonian is of the form -A*cos(p[i]*(phi[i]-phi0[i]))

    Shape Anisotropy Angle:
    Default: (none)
    If not set, the angles are randomly distributed over the circle, such that the prefered orientations are uncorrelated, if set they preferrably align in the same direction (up to p)

    Shape Anisotropy Distribution Type:
    Default: Fixed
    This gives the possible distributions for the local shape anisotropy. 
        Case Fixed:
            all have the same shape (potentially differently orientated)
        Case Uniform:
            the number of minima is equally distributed in {1,2,...,p}

    Shape Anisotropy p:
    Default: (none)
    Depending on the distribution, this parameter determines different things. 
        Case Fixed:
            The p to use for all (constant shape anisotropy)
        Case Uniform:
            the number of minima is equally distributed in {1,2,...,p} 

    Remarks:
        - In the program is distinguished by a disordered and a non disordered dipolar class via a template
        - Shape Anisotropy class gets only loaded if both, A and p_max are defined
        - If no Hamiltonian is loaded an error message should appear and the program terminate

|GEOMETRY DETAILS|
------------------
    LATTICE: Name of the Lattice to use
    Default: (none)
    This is determined by the ALPS library, refere to their list of appplicable lattices

    L: Linear length of lattice
    Default: (none)
    This is the linear length, not total number of sites (e.g. square lattice has L^2 sites)

    a: length of 1st basis vector
    Default: 1.

---------------------------
|OTHER PHYSICAL QUANTITIES|
---------------------------
    beta: inverse Temperature in natural units
    T: Temperature in natural units
    Default: (none)
    Define only one of them, otherwise undefined behaviour

----------------------
|SIMULATIONAL DETAILS|
----------------------
    THERMALIZATION: Number of Lattice Sweeps for thermalization
    Default: 100
    
    SWEEPS: Number of Measurements
    Default: 5000
    This is not the number of lattice sweeps but measurements (there is a factor inbetween determining the frequency of measurements)

    EACH_MEASUREMENT: Describes the Time between successive measurements
    Default: 15

    UPDATE: Type of Update Procedure to use
    Default: (none)
    at the moment only one update type is allowed, namely 'ssf', which stands for single spin flip. 

    Targeted Acceptance Ratio: Fraction of accepted steps to aim for
    Default: 0.5

    Angle Deviation Start: Which angle deviation to start with
    Default: PI/10.
    
    Angle Deviation Factor: Update factor for angle deviation
    Default: 1.2
    Determines the update factor such that the acceptance ratio will be achieved

    Angle Deviation Min: Lowest acceptable angle deviation
    Default: PI/1000.

    Angle Deviation Max: Maximal acceptable angle deviation
    Default: 2*PI

    Initialization: Initialize as...
    Default: "GS"
    Possible choices are:
        "GS":       Ground state
        "Random":   Randomized inital setup

    NUM_CLONES: Number of copies of simulation
    Default: 1
    This allows to use more compuation power for the same task, gather faster statistics, however the thermalization is not able to speed up with this

    SEED: Number seeding the RNG responsible for standart actions
    Default: (given by ALPS)
    This allows to seed your own RNG, however ALPS provides one if not given
    
    DISORDER_SEED: Number seeding the disorder RNG
    Default: (given by ALPS)
    This allows to seed your own RNG, however ALPS provides one if not given

    print debug information:
    Default: False
    Prints the periodic translations as well as the coordinates of each site, only use this for short tests, as otherwise the ouput files explode in length

|OBSERVABLES|
-------------
    MCRG
    ----
    mcrg_iteration_depth: Number of iterations done with MCRG
    Default: -1 (no MCRG measurement is done)

    MCRG Interactions: which correlations to actually measure
    Default: (none)
    Implemented in the interactions.h file, possible choices at the moment are:
        "small":                standart set, probably enough
        "medium interactions":  introduces a few more exotic interactions
        "medium range":         stays with rather conservative interactions, however increases the range compared to small
        "massive":              is broken and anyway too big for any use, at the moment DO NOT USE

    MCRG Reduction Technique:
    Default: (none)
    Implemented in the reductions.h file, possible choices at the moment are:
        "Decimation":           Uses only a 4th of the spins, ignoring the others
        "Blockspin":            Compute the average over 4 spins in a Block and use these as new ones
        "FerroBlockspin":       Same as Blockspin but first rotating the spins, such that the GS is transformed the ferromagnetic
        "Blockspin4x4":         Use the same as Blockspin but with 16(=4*4) spins
        "FerroBlockspin4x4":    Same as Blockspin4x4/FerroBlockspin, transform then average over 4*4 spins
    These are randomized in successive measurements over the starting points of the blocks

    Structure Factor
    ----------------
    structure_factor: Boolean if structure factor shall be measured
    Default: False

    Spin Autocorrelation Time
    -------------------------
    Spin Autocorrelation analysis length: In which depth to analyse the spin autocorrelation
    Default: -1
    As the full configuration get saved, this can be a time and mostly time consuming task, consider that the class contains (this parameter) * N doubles and in every measurement compare a configuration to all the old ones. Use smaller lattices to still have a fast access to the data
    
    Last Configuration
    -------------------------
    measure last configuration: boolean to determine if it should measure the last configuration or not
    Default: False

    Field Histogram
    ---------------
    Field Histogram: 
    Default: False
    Measure Field Histogram?
    	
    Field Histogram Measures per Measure: 
    Default: 1024
    Determines how many points get sampled for each configuration
    
    Field Histogram fixed z: 
    Default: true
    If set then each sample is drawn at same height, with a Gaussian
    distribution set by lower parameters If not set, then Field Histogram z
    determines the height

    Field Histogram z: 
    Default: 0.75
    Two fold parameter: if fixed z, this is the height of all samples, if not
    fixed z this is the mean of the Gaussian

    Field Histogram z stddev: 
    Default: 0.5
    Standard deviation for the Gaussian

    Field Histogram z cutoff: 
    Default: 0.1
    A truncation should be made (field to close in the layer of the dots leads
    to huge sample) it's controlled by this parameter. 

    Field Histogram cutoff: 
    Default: 3.
    Dots further away from the sampling site as this radius get ignored (this
    should shift the total field, however not the qualitative dependence due to
    short rangedness of the field in the quasi 2D set-up)

    Field Histogram diameter split: 
    Default: 1
    The dot can be split up into several parts to attribute the finite width of
    the experimental realization. The dot will be assumed circular. The dot
    will be split up in several parts, such that along the diameter in
    x-direction (and equivalently in y-direction) are this number of parts. The
    overal number of part contributing to the dipole of a single dot is given
    by as many dots that are inside the circle of this diameter.

    Dot Radius: 
    Default: 0.35
    This parameter describes the extension of the dot in parameters of the
    lattice periodicity a. The default value arises from one of the
    experimental realizations.

    M: The magnetization of each dot.
    Default: 1.
            
    Field Histogram number of bins: 
    Default: 128
    How many bins should the resulting histograms consist of?
