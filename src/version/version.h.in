// This uses the short git hash (7 alphanum chars), with a relatively high probability of a collision compared to the full (40 alphanum chars)
// However the number of commits, such that the probability of a collision is 1% is nearly 40k, for a 50% chance it is around 320k
// Compare also with birthday paradox, as the number of possible small hashes is (36^7 >> 320k)
// However not at all a problem, but rather useful to just use the small one and thinking of a very small chance of a collision
